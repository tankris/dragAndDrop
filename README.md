# Sortable Drag and Drop using Vanilla JS

This is a project intended to showcase a Sortable Drag and Drop feature using Vanilla JS

The main html has 4 items distributed in 2 different containers that can be moved via the mouse by dragging and dropping between the containers and also be sortable amongst other items within the container

Originally inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=296&v=jfYWwQrtzzY&feature=youtu.be), the project implements the same feature albeit with a different logic that works just as well

The logic used takes the same approach as mentioned in [this StackOverFlow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28962290) and has been changed to suit this project appropriately

The site is currently deployed on [GitHub pages](https://tankris.github.io/sortableDragAndDrop)
